        Hi there! I'm the creator behind <strong>The Gifted Piggy</strong> — a little workshop
        full of heart where every gift is made with love and dedication.
      </p>

      <h2>How it all began</h2>
      <p>
        My passion for handmade things started when I was young, when my grandmother taught me
        to knit and embroider. Over the years, this passion transformed into a true art: creating
        unique, personalized gifts that bring joy to loved ones.
      </p>

      <h2>Why handmade?</h2>
      <p>
        In a world full of mass-produced items, a handmade gift says <em>"I thought of you"</em>.
        Every piece I create is unique — you won't find two identical ones. I put my heart into
        every detail, from choosing materials to packaging.
      </p>

      <h2>What I create</h2>
      <p>
        Personalized gift baskets, scented candles, natural care products and many other beautiful
        surprises. If you have an idea or a special event, you can contact me for a gift created
        especially for you.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thank you for being part of The Gifted Piggy story! 🐷
